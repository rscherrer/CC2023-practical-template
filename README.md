# CC2023-QG

Practical on quantitative genetics for the 2023 edition of the [Crash Course in Evolutionary Biology](https://evobiocrashcourse.github.io/).

What sort of exercises do we want in this practical?

-   Shows that many genes can produce continuous trait variation
-   Show that bimodal populations can produce continuously spread offspring when hybridizing
-   Show that the breeder's equation works with simulations
-   Show an example of bivariate simulation
-   Show that small-effect QTLs might go unnoticed
-   Show that additive effects can emerge and break down under epistasis
-   Some exercise with measuring heritability?
-   Ask how the environment may be a source of variation too?
